<h1 align="center">Project Overview.</h1>

This is a simple PHP-based blog application using TailwindCSS for styling.<br>

It follows a mobile-first and accessible frontend design approach.<br>

The homepage (index.php) displays a list of blog posts with pagination.<br>

Each blog post shows a featured image, title, short description, and "Read More" link.<br>

The single post page (blog.php) displays the full content of a selected post.<br>

The admin panel (/admin) is protected by a hardcoded login (lemon/lemon) or Secure login (user: lemon, pass: lemon) to manage content.<br>

Admin users can create, edit, and delete blog posts with image uploads.<br>

Uploaded images are stored in the uploads/ folder with timestamped filenames.<br>

Settings allow configuration of how many posts show per page.<br>

All PHP code is written using OOP principles, organized under the LH namespace.<br>
